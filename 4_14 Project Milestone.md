4/14 Project Milestone

Idea 1: Predict Author Based on Writing Sample
-	Data: Scrape Google Books for a subset of authors (not sure how difficult that would be)
-	Train the model on this dataset and then for any sample of text provided predict the most likely author of that sample
- 	Potentially do unsupervised ML as preprocessing in order to understand what metrics would actually be meaningful, what the determinants of an author's "style" actually are

Idea 2: Predict User Outcomes at My Job
-	I work at a company that has a marketplace for financial products, primarily student loan refinancing
-	We get paid when someone accepts an offer that they received from one of the lenders that we partner with, so understanding more about which users are likely to do so is very valuable
-	Data: Our user db, which has observations about demographic characteristics of users, their financial details, what marketing source they came from, etc.
